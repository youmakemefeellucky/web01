  <h1 class="red">How living in Berlin has changed me for life</h1>

  <p style="margin-top:30px;">Over the years, as visitors from my home in the US have come to visit me in <strong>Berlin</strong>, I've always tried to show them what makes this city so great.
  <br> But this is hard to do in just a few days, as what I love most about Berlin is the unexpected: stumbling upon an S-Bahn party, discovering a hidden, basement jazz concert, and finding a taxi driver who will sing Backstreet Boys with you along your 6am ride home. </p>

  <h4 class="blue">1. Never wearing heels to a club again</h4>
  <p> I knew in most cities I visited or lived in prior to Berlin was pretty much the same: both men and women dressed to impress, which generally involved heels or other uncomfortable clothing for us females - which I always hated. Dressing down could mean you didn’t make it through the door, especially at the more famous venues.<br>
  But the rules are turned on their head in Berlin, where you’ll likely hear a “nein” from the bouncer if you dress up too much, particularly at Berlin’s exclusive - and probably best - club, <a target="_black" href="http://berghain.de/">Berghain</a>. Explaining this to those outside the city can elicit looks of shock as well as wonderment.<br>
  So I’ve come to embrace this laid-back attitude towards nightlife, where the people in sneakers and ripped jeans get ahead of those in designer stilettos or button-downs. And never do I plan to look back.</p>
