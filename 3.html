    So you’ve become a <strong>Berlin</strong> expat. Or maybe you’re an aspiring Berlin expat. You’re looking for a job in Berlin and are wondering exactly how people go about finding work in the German capital.</p>

    <p>
    You’ve probably heard the expression that “Berlin is poor, but sexy.” While I personally hate the reference (it’s way too overused), it has a certain truth. While Berlin’s known to be a creative mecca for artists and a technology hub for startups, it’s not exactly a place booming with high-paying jobs that you might find elsewhere, like in the automobile capital of Stuttgart or the financial hub of Frankfurt. As of August 2016, unemployment hovered around 9.7% in Berlin, while the rest of Germany remained at a rate of about 6.1%. Factor in not being able to speak German fluently and/or not being an EU citizen, you’ll find the odds of finding a job in Berlin are stacked against you.
